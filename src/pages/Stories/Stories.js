        my own website for a while now and when I stumbled upon Ubers Base web I tought that now it is time to finally create one.
        Not to comfortable with javascript (or react for that matter) either, so this seems like a good training session as well. This is me just testing
        out to write a story, hopefully it seems okay!</p> <p>Currently these stories are written inside the function,
        going to find a better solution going forward. But this will suffice for now</p></p>
